/**
 * The annotation block every reading tool of this server carries.
 *
 * Written out rather than left to the defaults, because the defaults are not
 * neutral: the specification says `destructiveHint` and `openWorldHint` both
 * default to **true**, so an omitted field is the *stronger* claim. A tool that
 * says nothing is a destructive tool in an open world.
 *
 * `openWorldHint: false` is the honest answer here: this server talks to the one
 * wg-easy instance it is configured for. The specification's own example draws
 * the line there — a web search is an open world, a box you point at is not.
 *
 * Note what `readOnlyHint: true` does *not* say. `get_client_config` and
 * `get_client_qrcode` read rather than write, and they hand back a client's
 * private key while doing it. Read-only is a statement about the server's
 * state, not about how harmless the answer is.
